Improvements to the traditional 88-key interface. Currently planned:
* Auto-correct (for the traditional classical repertoire)
* Automatic chord voicings (for jazz improvization)
* Improved left-hand controls for stride piano

The goal is to free the pianist from the technical aspects of
performance, in order to permit a greater focus on expression and
musicality.
